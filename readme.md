## Commands

Run `/audioplayer` to get general information on how to upload files.

**Uploading audio files via URL**

Run `/audioplayer url "https://example.com/myaudio.mp3"` where `https://example.com/myaudio.mp3` is the link to
your `.mp3` or `.wav` file.

**Uploading audio files directly to the server**

Copy your `.mp3` or `.wav` file to the `audioplayer_uploads` folder in your server.
Run `/audioplayer serverfile "yourfile.mp3"` where `yourfile.mp3` is the name of the file you put on the server.

**Uploading audio files via Filebin**

Run `/audioplayer filebin` and follow the instructions.

**Putting custom audio on a music disc or goat horn**

Run `/audioplayer apply <ID>` and hold a **music disc**, **goat horn** or **head** in your main hand.
Additionally, you can add a custom name and range to the item `/audioplayer apply <ID> <RANGE> "<CUSTOM-TEXT>"`.

It's also possible to bulk apply audio to more than one item at a time by holding a shulker box in your hand.

Starting with version `1.9.1`, you can also apply custom audio by its original file name:
`/audioplayer apply "<FILE_NAME>"`.
This command works with and without the file extension (like `.mp3` or `.wav`).
Note that the file name must be unique for this to work.

**Getting the audio from an existing item**

Run `/audioplayer id` while holding a music disc, goat horn or head with custom audio in your main hand.

**Getting the audio file name from an existing item**

Run `/audioplayer name` while holding a music disc, goat horn or head with custom audio in your main hand.
