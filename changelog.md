- Expose `createInfoMessage` to the API


**WARNING**

Version 2.x.x is not compatible with version 1.x.x!

Your old data gets partially migrated and might work, but it is strongly discouraged to use version 2.x.x
with worlds created with version 1.x.x as it may cause issues down the line with items that contain old audio data.
